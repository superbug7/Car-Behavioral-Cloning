# **How to train your Car** 

We will utilize Deep Learning techniques to predict the angle of car turn and compare it with ground truth and train over iterations to have model learn right weights. Once the weights are set with minimal error, we will let the car loose on a track to see how it performs in autonomous mode.

## Behavioral Cloning Project

**The goals of this project are the following:**

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
